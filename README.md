# Pacmon
A project of a simple game based on a Pacman arcade game, written in Java using Eclipse. 

It was a final project for one of the studies subject, in 2017.

It was my first contact with real Java.

#How to launch?

To launch the game you need to either compile the class Game or start the PAKMON1.1.jar file, which is included in the repository.
